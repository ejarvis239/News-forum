### UX

* Maybe have the username of the current user more prominently shown throughout the site instead of just on the homepage.
*  Vote buttons set votes to 1 or -1. Optimistic rendering is doing something different to the backend. Can’t ever get votes to 0.
* Categories that 404.
* Deleting, commenting, and voting all have a nice response that you can see happening. However, you don’t need to set the state with a filtered list of comments in a then block. Render the updated comment list optimistically so the response is instant.

### Functionality 

* Cannot log out without clearing cookies.
* Voting on articles and comments is broken.

### Error Handling 

* 404 Error page done.
* Incorrect username logs a 500 error but gives no indication.
* Posting comment with no body log a 400 but gives no indication.
